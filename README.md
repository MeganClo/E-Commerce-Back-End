## Description
This is a fuctional Express.js API that has routes built to connect with a database using Sequelize. When a user enters the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySql database. The user is able to successfully use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags.
